            <h1>How it's all started</h1>
            <img class="young-hayao" src="img/youth.jpg" alt="Young Hayao Miyazaki" width="400", length="500" >

            
            <p class="hayao-facts-1">
                Miyazaki’s father was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, a manufacturing concern that built parts for Zero fighter planes. The family business instilled in Miyazaki a love of flying that became apparent in virtually all of his work. 
                After having completed studies in economics at Gakushūin University, Tokyo, in 1963, he took a position as an entry-level animator at Tōei Animation, a division of the Tōei studio and Asia’s largest producer of animation. 
                <br>While at Tōei, he met fellow animators Takahata Isao and Ōta Akemi. The former became a lifelong friend, collaborator, and business partner, and the latter, after a one-year courtship, became his wife. Miyazaki moved through the ranks at Tōei, working on such projects as the television series Ōkami shōnen Ken (“Wolf Boy Ken”) and Takahata’s feature directorial debut, Taiyō no ōji: Horusu no daibōken (1968; Little Norse Prince). 
                <br>After leaving Tōei in 1971, Miyazaki, accompanied by Takahata, continued to work for various studios throughout the 1970s. Highlights from this period included the Panda kopanda (Panda! Go Panda!) film shorts and Miyazaki’s first full-length film, Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro (1979; Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro), an adventure story featuring the gentleman thief Lupin and his compatriots.</p></li>
             
            <p class="hayao-facts-2">Miyazaki’s individual style became more apparent in Kaze no tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind), a monthly manga (Japanese cartoon) strip he wrote for Animage magazine. 
                The story followed Naushika, a princess and reluctant warrior, on her journey through an ecologically ravaged world. Its success inspired a film of the same name (released in 1984) and encouraged Miyazaki and Takahata to undertake a more permanent partnership arrangement. 
                Together they launched <a href="file:///Users/julia/Desktop/project0/ghibli.html"><b>Studio Ghibli</b></a> in 1985. <br>The following year Miyazaki’s Tenkū no shiro Rapyuta (Castle in the Sky) was released in Japan and Nausicaä was released in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. Although the original film’s impressive aerial sequences remained intact, confusing edits and poor dubbing rendered Warriors of the Wind virtually unwatchable. 
               <br> More than a decade would pass before Miyazaki would consider another Western release. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli continued to produce works for the domestic market, however. <b>[1]</b></p>
